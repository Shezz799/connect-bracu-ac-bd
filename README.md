# Login Page Replica

A static replica of the "BracU Central Login" page based on the provided screenshot. Built with vanilla HTML and CSS, ready for Vercel static deployment.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — page markup with image placeholders
- `styles.css` — styling to closely match the screenshot (responsive)
- `assets/` — placeholder SVGs for the logo and Google "G"
- `vercel.json` — minimal config for static deployment (optional but handy)

## Local preview
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or
- Use any static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) to preview.

## Deploying to Vercel (optional)
If you use Vercel CLI, from this folder you can run the usual `vercel` flow to deploy as a static site. No build step or dependencies required.

## Replacing placeholders
- Replace `assets/logo-placeholder.svg` with your real logo (keep roughly the same size for best results).
- Background doodles and the bottom cityscape are simulated. If you have the real artwork, we can swap the CSS background with actual images.

## Next pages
Send the next screenshot(s) and I’ll add new pages (or a multi-page structure) to this project, keeping everything Vercel-ready.
